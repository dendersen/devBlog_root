    <p>this project was started BEFORE the blog, future updates follow but everything before 27/09 2025 is missing</p>
    

    <h1>the begining</h1>
    <p>27/09 2025</p>
    <p>at this point the goal was simply to improve ease of upload</p>
    <p>to do this i made a CSV file containing all the pictures and the methode for displaying</p>
    <p>this CSV file is read in javascript which adds the picture to the html page in runtime, making it easy to add new pictures</p>
    <p>the CSV file is located at: <a href="https://www.dendersen.dk/pictureList.csv">pictures.csv</a></p>
    <p>an example of each of the 3 styles can be found in the table below</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>style</th>
        <th>picture link</th>
        <th>alternate picture</th>
        <th>name of picture</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>normal</th>
        <th>destination.JPG</th>
        <th></th>
        <th>destination</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>double</th>
        <th>hidden beauty.tif</th>
        <th>hidden beauty.JPG</th>
        <th>hidden beauty</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>featured</th>
        <th>planets.JPG</th>
        <th>planetsAlt.JPG</th>
        <th>planets</th>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>when it comes to assembling the csv file into the website, i created a script to assemble the document details that are identical to the old version of the html, this way the website doesn't change but the updat is much simpler.</p>
    <p>this uses the fetch function to read line by line without needing the website to finish loading first using async</p>
