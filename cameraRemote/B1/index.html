    <p>in planning we start by looking into what equipment is already laying around, i already have an arduino nano not being used, and an OLED screen (with i2c) used for an old school assignment. using these i plan to first make the user interface, of course there will be no way of editing the information at the start so it will only be displaying data and possibly turning on an LED for the given amount of time</p>
    <p>when i have that working i plan to get a knob to alow me to change the values without needing to recompile the program each time</p>
    <p>finally to interact with the camera i will need to short the to contact on the aux jack connected to the camera, to do that i will need a digital switch, the type of which i have yet to decide on, but i will need to be active for a long period with using large  amounts of energy, lastly it must be able to handle the voltage at which the camera is running at, which is currently unknown to me as i haven't measured it</p>
