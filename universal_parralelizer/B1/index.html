    <p>the backcone of the threading system is already mostly complete but to test it and make sure that the program is running at without error i have further devoled on the simple demo currently in main.c</p>
    <p>for this it will be expanded to also test a pool with only a single thread, and to run a version where we simply call a similar function without using the pool system</p>
    <p>this will allow me to compare the time taken for each of the three methods, and see how much overhead the threading system adds, this also tests the edgecase of a single thread in a pool</p>
    <p>finally these will be used to show how the program is supposed to work as an example for future users of the program</p>
