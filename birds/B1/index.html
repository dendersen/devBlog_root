    <h1>data usage</h1>
    <p>22/09 2025</p>
    <p>at this point the goal was simply to minimise data usage of the website</p>
    <p>previousely the website would load all images at full quality (all 1000 pictures of 11 mb) this will kill any mobile data connection</p>
    <p>to fix this i made a sccript that generates an array going from 1-n where n is the number of pictures, this then gets randomly shuffled</p>
    
    <p>now when displaying the images we load a small amount of images (10) at a time, and we add in a button to load the next pictures</p>
    <p>on to of this the ability to unshuffle dthe pictures was added, and the ability to jump to a specific point in the array of pictures</p>
    <p>lastly the pictures where replaced with thumnails that where significantly smaller </p>
